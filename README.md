# React Starwars App

## Description: 

Exploring ReactJS, Function Components, component state and side effects.
In this challenge, create a web page that presents a styled list of Star Wars characters. Being able to render out data to a web page is a large part of what JavaScript developers do, this challenge assesses your ability to achieve such a task.

## Minimum Viable Product
Your finished project must include all of the following requirements:

 - [ ] Fetch a list of Star Wars characters from the Star Wars API (or SWAPI) and render them to the screen.
 - [ ] Follow the documentation to learn how to fetch a list of "people". However, don't spend too long on this. Here is a link for you to follow if you've looked around the docs for about 15 minutes or so and haven't found where to go - Secret Link to Awesomeness ðŸ¤«.
 - [ ] Set the data you fetch to state.
 - [ ] Map over the list and render a component for each character on the page.
 - [ ] You must display at least one element for each star wars character in the data set.
 - [ ] The elements must be styled with either SemanticUI or styled-components - don't rely on browser default styles.

#### Required best practices:
 - [ ] Consistent naming. Examples: variables, functions, Components, and file/folder organization.
 - [ ] Consistent spacing. Examples: line breaks, around arguments and before/after functions.
 - [ ] Consistent quotation usage.
 - [ ] Spell-check.
 - [ ] Schedule time to review, refine and reassess your work.

## Stretch Problems
 - [ ] Add at least one test using a testing tool:
 - react-testing-library
 - Cypress
 
 - [ ] Build a pagination system that will allow you to load the next page of data.
 - console.log() the data coming back from the server.
 - Notice that there are next and previous fields that give you a URL.
 - You can build a function that will get characters called getCharacters that you can use dynamically to get the next or previous set of characters. You would need to supply it with the proper fields, and you'll need to set up more state to do this.
